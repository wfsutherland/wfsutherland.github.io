# __About Me__

## Hobbies, Interests, etc.
I have many and varied interests that I've built up (part of having ADHD), but in terms of things that have made it past the hyper-fixation stage:

- **Video Games/ Game Development:** I've been passionate about video games every since I could hold a controller. I've actually been in the industry for the past _9 years!_ Unfortunately, the industry is in such a state that I am no longer able to maintain my current trajectory, so I must pursue other options. **_But_** that doesn't mean I've given up my passion.

- **Knife shaprening/repair:** A recent hobby that I've picked up. It's a relaxing activity that helps with the stress of the day to day. If you ever need a knife sharpened or repaired, I'm more than happy to do it for a nominal fee.

- **Lo-fi Music:** I do actually make lo-fi versions of video game songs under the name [Level-Up Lo-Fi][Soundcloud link].

## Websites I Recommend
- [Youtube][youtube]: Can learn almost anything for free on Youtube (that's where I learned to sharpen and repair knives).

> [!Caution]
> Be careful with whom you listen to, and make sure you get your information from multiple sources.

- [Udemy][udemy]: Another great place to learn skills if you're looking for something a bit better than Youtube. Courses can add up, but they go on sale _very_ frequently.
